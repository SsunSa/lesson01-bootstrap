    <h1 class="main-title">Welcome to My Bio Page</h1>

    <p class="bio-text">
      Hello, my name is Sarahi Portillo. I'm an aspiring artist and coder who is passionate about creativity and self-expression. I'm currently working on building up my skills to support my future goal of doing art commissions through my own website.
    </p>

    <p class="bio-text">
      The reason I am taking this course is out of personal interest. I want to learn how to properly set up websites from scratch so I can build a portfolio site and accept art commissions online in a professional and appealing way.
    </p>

    <p class="bio-text">
      I hope to gain hands-on experience in coding and website development. Although I'm new to web design, I do have experience in other programming languages such as Java, Eclipse, and C++. This class will help me expand those skills into the web world.
    </p>
