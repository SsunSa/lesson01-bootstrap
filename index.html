      <h1>Welcome to My Bio Page</h1>

      <p>
        Hello, my name is Sarahi Portillo. I'm an aspiring artist and coder who is passionate about creativity and
        self-expression. I'm currently working on building up my skills to support my future goal of doing art commissions
        through my own website.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason I am taking this course is out of personal interest. I want to learn how to properly set up websites from
        scratch so I can build a portfolio site and accept art commissions online in a professional and appealing way.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope to gain hands-on experience in coding and website development. Although I'm new to web design, I do have
        experience in other programming languages such as Java, Eclipse, and C++. This class will help me expand those skills
        into the web world.
      </p>
